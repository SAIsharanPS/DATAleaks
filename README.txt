Okay, Here is a small brief about the project

I took the data from reddit since I had the issue with the Twitter API something about the issue with the premium/Free,

So, Since there was a second opt for the data scrapping i have used the API praw which is the offical API of reddit

Okay 
 NOTE:
 Please change the data CVS locations which are metioned in the code to the local host which is run by you aka the file location to run the data 

 ORDER 
1 dataScap
2 DataEx
3 Dataan
4 Datavis

CVS 
Please dont change the CLient and secret code this will cause the code to fall  apart :v

Hoping to here from CAPX soon!
