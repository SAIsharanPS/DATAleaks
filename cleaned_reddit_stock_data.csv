26,44,1728648554.0,"TESLA CYBERCAB VS WAYMO : AN ANALYSIS  For all the regards who don't know, Waymo is the market leader in true autonomous vehicles right now. They have been operating a fleet of robo taxis (fully autonomous cars) in multiple cities for a while now. 

So I did a short comparison and analysis. 



KEY POINTS FROM ""WE, ROBOT"" EVENT:



1. The robotaxi is a purpose-built autonomous vehicle, lacking a steering wheel or pedals, meaning it will need approval from regulators before going into production.

.
.

2. Tesla plans to launch fully autonomous driving in Texas and California next year, with the Cybercab production by 2026 — although he said it could be as late as 2027. 

.
.

3. Tesla is developing the Optimus robot, which could be available for $20,000-$30,000, and is capable of performing various tasks.


.
.

4. Cybercab was revealed the prototype robotaxi at Tesla's ""We, Robot” event held at the Warner Bros. film lot in Burbank, California, with a lot of non-public roads for the demonstration. 


.
.

5. Tesla has reportedly been mapping the area in advance of the demonstration, even though the company says it doesn't rely on high-definition maps to power its Full Self-Driving (FSD) driver-assist feature


.
.
.


TESLA VS WAYMO : KEY DIFFERENCES IN TECHNOLOGY AND APPROACH 



.
.

1. Sensing the World:

 -  - Waymo's Multi-Sensor Fusion:  Waymo uses a suite of sensors that work together. This is like having multiple senses.


I. Lidar:  Acts like super-precise radar, creating a 3D ""point cloud"" of the surroundings. This excels in low-light and complex environments.

II. Radar: Detects objects and their speed, even in rain or fog.
   

III. Cameras: Provide visual information for recognizing objects like traffic lights and pedestrians.




- - Tesla's Vision-Only System: Tesla relies heavily on cameras, believing that they can provide enough data for AI to understand the world like humans do.


I. Neural Networks:  Tesla uses powerful AI to process the visual data from cameras.


II. No Lidar:  Tesla famously excludes lidar, arguing it's expensive and unnecessary.


- Why this matters:  Lidar provides highly accurate depth and distance data, which is crucial for navigating complex situations. Tesla's vision-only approach is more ambitious but may struggle in conditions where cameras are less effective (e.g., heavy rain, fog).



.
.


2. Understanding the Environment:

I. Waymo's HD Maps: Waymo creates incredibly detailed 3D maps of the areas where its vehicles operate. These maps include road geometry, lane markings, traffic signs, and even the positions of trees and buildings.


II.  Localization: This allows Waymo's cars to precisely locate themselves within the map, even in challenging conditions.


III. Predictability:  Maps help anticipate what's coming and plan routes accordingly.


IV.  Tesla's Real-Time Learning: Tesla relies less on pre-mapped environments. Its AI learns to interpret the world in real-time, based on the data it gathers from its cameras.


V. Generalization: The goal is to create a system that can drive anywhere, not just in pre-mapped areas.


VI. Adaptability: Tesla's system can potentially adapt to new environments and situations more quickly.



- - Why this matters: Waymo's HD maps provide a high level of certainty in known areas, but mapping is expensive and time-consuming. Tesla's approach is more scalable but relies heavily on the AI's ability to correctly interpret complex scenes.



.
.
.

3. Deployment Strategies:

I. Waymo's Gradual Rollout: Waymo has focused on deploying its robotaxi service in specific cities, starting with Phoenix. This allows for careful testing and refinement in controlled environments.


II.  Safety First:  Waymo prioritizes safety and has a strong track record.

III.  Controlled Expansion:  They expand their service area gradually as they gain confidence in their technology.



 IV.  Tesla's Beta Testing: Tesla has released its Full Self-Driving (FSD) beta software to a wider group of drivers. This allows them to gather vast amounts of real-world driving data.


V.  Rapid Iteration:  Tesla can quickly improve its system through frequent software updates.


 VI. Driver Responsibility:  FSD is still a driver-assist system, and drivers are expected to remain vigilant and take over when necessary.


- -  Why this matters: Waymo's approach is more cautious, prioritizing safety and controlled testing. Tesla's approach is faster and more agile, but it also carries more risk, as evidenced by accidents involving FSD.



These are some of the core differences between Waymo and Tesla's approach to self-driving. Both companies are pushing the boundaries of technology, but their philosophies and strategies are quite distinct. It will be fascinating to see how these approaches evolve in the years to come.




. . . . .


. . . . .

TLDR;


for me personally, the event was disappointing. Elon announced (NOT ACTUALLY LAUNCHED) basically what he has been promising for years (TRUE AUTONOMY AKA FSD).

It was no different than the previous announcements of FSD and Cybertruk.

I expect delays (regulatory approvals and the actual tech being ready)


. . . . .

For all the regards who don't understand what WAYMO actually is, I just did another post analyzing Google (the owner of Waymo) and why they're the number 1 player in AI.

5,6,1728653629.0,"Overstock.com (BYON) - DD - Bath Towels Are Back In Stock \*\*ATTENTION MODS AND HONOURABLE REPORT POLICE OF NEW: This DD and the company it covers is in no way related to the bankrupt legacy towel stock (RIP bagholders). This company was [Overstock.com](http://Overstock.com) and has rebranded itself. Bath towels are back, and they're better than ever before.

Alright, listen up, you’re only going to hear this once, and you’re only going to hear it from me, as no one else seems to be paying attention. I’ve been watching this company for YEARS waiting for the perfect moment to get in, and that moment is right now. Actually, it was last week on the day the last vestiges of peace Jared Kushner bestowed upon the Middle East finally evaporated. While simultaneously, the dock workers decided they were going to try to strongarm JPow into spinning up his money printer exclusively for their use --to fund their righteous battle against our future robot overlords. That day the stock hit a low of $8.91. The bottom is in.

About the Company:

[Overstock.com](http://Overstock.com) has been around a very long time, since 1999, but basically all you need to know about that is that they started out doing the thing their name suggests. Then they switched it up and started selling a more standard lineup of home goods. Their name just didn't reflect what they did anymore.

In 2023, the former crowd favorite’s bath towel retailer went tits up, and the CEO of Overstock at the time saw a golden opportunity. They snapped up the IP of ye old towel stock, along with the name, customer data, etc.. They rebranded the company to Beyond Inc., switched their website UI’s color scheme from red to blue, and slapped the old towel company’s name on it. (From here on I’ll refer to the forbidden name as triple-B, or 3B for short.)

But somehow it wasn't an instant success... Overstock's original customers were left out in the cold, and the returning bath towel customers didn't like their product lineup. Things kept on declining.

Enter Marcus Lemonis:



https://preview.redd.it/yi3ayo0yw4ud1.png?width=508&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a79453f4375c3d023bbe6b615fea95091281919

He currently serves as the chairman and CEO of Camping World, a multi-billion dollar giant. He’s an activist investor specializing in turning around struggling businesses, and was key in building Camping World into what it is today. In Late 2023 he purchased a stake in Beyond and joined the board. He laid out plans to turn the business around, bring back [Overstock.com](http://Overstock.com), and promised results by the end of 2024. Well...things took longer than expected, including the relaunch of the [Overstock.com](http://Overstock.com) website.

So this is what happened:

  


https://preview.redd.it/k29wwhq1x4ud1.png?width=1407&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6f07b394c5fae9a6100f0485d99947b5ca5fa0f

Now the stock is in the gutter, but the vision Lemonis has for the company is finally starting to come together.

If you only care about earnings reports and staring at charts you might look at those and say to me:

“Mr. Jimbles, you’re *highly* regarded. The revenue, EPS, and every other metric is worse YoY. The stock has been red every month for the past 6. This stock is going back to all-time lows, and likely, to zero.”

And to which I will respond:

“Why yes, thank you. I am highly regarded. You have an incredible talent for numbers and analysis. Slap an F rating on the stock, and go apply for a job at Motley Fool. They’d love to have you. You’ll fit right in there.”

But this what has happened very recently:

* In July 2024 the [Overstock.com](http://Overstock.com) website relaunched to exist alongside the new 3B website, specializing again in liquidating surplus inventory. 
* The Zulily IP, customer data, etc. was purchased in March of this year. If you haven’t heard of Zulily, they were another successful online retailer that went under after suffering from poor management, losing focus, and poor customer service, but the website had a cult following for its unique and exclusive selection of fashion goods.
* Beyond Inc. hired some of Zulily’s former team, and are bringing back your mom’s favorite fashion brands. They just soft-launched the new website a few weeks ago, but haven’t made any official announcement yet. [Zulily.com](http://zulily.com)
* Three new strategic partnerships have been teased that will restore a physical retail presence to the 3B brand. Now you might be thinking to yourself that this is a bad move, but having a physical store makes a lot of sense for home goods. Last I checked, you can’t download a credenza, and some people like to make sure the drapes match the carpet in person. One of these partnerships will deal with the Overstock arm of the business and will give them access to increased inventory and infrastructure to move what they already have.
* They just announced a new global licensing program to expand business internationally.
* They sold off their company HQ offices for $55m. Their balance sheet is good. Almost zero debt and plenty of cash for their upcoming moves.

But that isn’t it by a long-shot. Lemonis has a vision for the Beyond umbrella to expand and include a whole slew of home related products and services including mortgages, home insurance, HELOCs, consumer credit cards, etc.. They plan to leverage the customer data gained from the retail businesses to onboard their existing customers for these other products in a frictionless, low cost way.

And even though this pivot is finally taking shape now, none of it has been priced in. It may have been last fall based solely on hype when Lemonis joined the board, when the stock hit almost $40, but it definitely isn’t as of right now. Lucky me.

Maybe some other charts and light TA will convince you though.

What we have right here is RSI divergence on the weekly chart. The stock price is marching down, making lower lows, while RSI is trending up, making higher lows. Titillating, I know.

You like Bollinger Bands??? Well here you go:

On the daily, it’s consolidated, and the bands are tight enough to turn your wife’s boyfriend into a two pump chump. You can see it bounced hard off the bottom band in the past few days.

Look at what happened last Friday when the dock workers settled for an insulting 62% raise and a guarantee that efficiency would not get in the way of union boss salaries:

So what makes me sooooo smart and special? Nothing. I just happen to be in the right place at the right time. Like I said, I’ve been watching this stock/company for years as a matter of personal interest. This is the inflection point. No one cares about this stock and most people still think the 3B brand no longer exists at all. Analysts are asleep at the wheel, relying on ChatGPT to do their work for them, and GPT doesn’t know how to spoof an email and listen to a webcast yet.

Here’s the webcast featuring Lemonis that took place on Sept. 10:

[https://investors.beyond.com/news-events/events-and-presentations/events/event-details/2024/Piper-Sandler-Growth-Frontiers-Conference/default.aspx](https://investors.beyond.com/news-events/events-and-presentations/events/event-details/2024/Piper-Sandler-Growth-Frontiers-Conference/default.aspx) 

Listen to it…or don’t. I don’t care. Lemonis goes into much more detail about the upcoming partnerships that will be announced at the investor conference happening on the day of earnings, as well as his vision for the company going forward. And he explains it all much better than some random regard on reddit ever could. He also takes ownership for the past mistakes that got us to where we are now.

If you still aren’t convinced, cool. Go buy calls into NVIDIA earnings and enjoy crying in your wife’s boyfriend’s arms for a few days just like last time. Or buy the top on that incredible space stock after it’s up 20x in less than 6 months, get rug-pulled with a $400m share offering, and get rekt by the news drought. Or go do what Nana would want --buying deep ITMs in her meme stock... at least *she* might be proud of you.

So what do I expect with the BYON stock?

Short/medium term: Up.  
Long term: Really up.

It looks good long term as everything spins up and the company transitions over the course of the next year. I don’t think analysts have accounted for the $177m run rate the newly relaunched Overstock website has hit since it went live at the beginning of Q3, or the fact that Zulily has been online for weeks already. Earnings will likely hit or exceed expectations, and even if it doesn’t, the partnerships being unveiled at the investor meeting and forward guidance will be impressive. There will likely be a runup even before earnings. When this stock moves, it MOVES.

Here are my current positions as of writing this, but I'm not done buying yet...not even close. A YOLO update will follow after I've finished.

Shotgun approach. Who knows when this thing will make its biggest moves.

The random smattering of strikes may make you think I'm even more regarded than before, but liquidity is extremely thin and there were hot deals on different strikes at different times.

\*\*Tips if you feel this is a play you want to make and realize that if you just buy shares you're throwing your future gains in the trash:

Liquidity on most option strikes/expiries is THIN, especially on the OTMs. Wait. wait. *wait.* You're thinking you'll just avoid all this by buying ITM/NTM? On a stock this undervalued?? Go back to where you belong. You know...that special sub where their best and only advice is DCA'ing into SPY.

I recommend doing limits or 1 lot market orders b/c you might even get a few better fills that way. If you do big market orders you’re gonna get cucked on the way in and on the way out… if you make it that far. If you don’t know what the word slippage means...good luck. \*\*Hint\*\* It doesn't have anything to do with what happens to your wife while watching you unbutton her boyfriend's sport-coat.

See y'all in a bit.

alright listen up youre only going to hear this once and youre only going to hear it from me as no one else seems to be paying attention ive been watching this company for years waiting for the perfect moment to get in and that moment is right now actually it was last week on the day the last vestiges of peace jared kushner bestowed upon the middle east finally evaporated while simultaneously the dock workers decided they were going to try to strongarm jpow into spinning up his money printer exclusively for their use to fund their righteous battle against our future robot overlords that day the stock hit a low of  the bottom is in

about the company

overstockcom has been around a very long time since  but basically all you need to know about that is that they started out doing the thing their name suggests then they switched it up and started selling a more standard lineup of home goods their name just didnt reflect what they did anymore

in  the former crowd favorites bath towel retailer went tits up and the ceo of overstock at the time saw a golden opportunity they snapped up the ip of ye old towel stock along with the name customer data etc they rebranded the company to beyond inc switched their website uis color scheme from red to blue and slapped the old towel companys name on it from here on ill refer to the forbidden name as tripleb or b for short

but somehow it wasnt an instant success overstocks original customers were left out in the cold and the returning bath towel customers didnt like their product lineup things kept on declining

enter marcus lemonis





he currently serves as the chairman and ceo of camping world a multibillion dollar giant hes an activist investor specializing in turning around struggling businesses and was key in building camping world into what it is today in late  he purchased a stake in beyond and joined the board he laid out plans to turn the business around bring back overstockcom and promised results by the end of  wellthings took longer than expected including the relaunch of the overstockcom website

so this is what happened

  




now the stock is in the gutter but the vision lemonis has for the company is finally starting to come together

if you only care about earnings reports and staring at charts you might look at those and say to me

mr jimbles youre highly regarded the revenue eps and every other metric is worse yoy the stock has been red every month for the past  this stock is going back to alltime lows and likely to zero

and to which i will respond

why yes thank you i am highly regarded you have an incredible talent for numbers and analysis slap an f rating on the stock and go apply for a job at motley fool theyd love to have you youll fit right in there

but this what has happened very recently

 in july  the overstockcom website relaunched to exist alongside the new b website specializing again in liquidating surplus inventory 
 the zulily ip customer data etc was purchased in march of this year if you havent heard of zulily they were another successful online retailer that went under after suffering from poor management losing focus and poor customer service but the website had a cult following for its unique and exclusive selection of fashion goods
 beyond inc hired some of zulilys former team and are bringing back your moms favorite fashion brands they just softlaunched the new website a few weeks ago but havent made any official announcement yet zulilycom
 three new strategic partnerships have been teased that will restore a physical retail presence to the b brand now you might be thinking to yourself that this is a bad move but having a physical store makes a lot of sense for home goods last i checked you cant download a credenza and some people like to make sure the drapes match the carpet in person one of these partnerships will deal with the overstock arm of the business and will give them access to increased inventory and infrastructure to move what they already have
 they just announced a new global licensing program to expand business internationally
 they sold off their company hq offices for m their balance sheet is good almost zero debt and plenty of cash for their upcoming moves

but that isnt it by a longshot lemonis has a vision for the beyond umbrella to expand and include a whole slew of home related products and services including mortgages home insurance helocs consumer credit cards etc they plan to leverage the customer data gained from the retail businesses to onboard their existing customers for these other products in a frictionless low cost way

and even though this pivot is finally taking shape now none of it has been priced in it may have been last fall based solely on hype when lemonis joined the board when the stock hit almost  but it definitely isnt as of right now lucky me

maybe some other charts and light ta will convince you though





what we have right here is rsi divergence on the weekly chart the stock price is marching down making lower lows while rsi is trending up making higher lows titillating i know

you like bollinger bands well here you go

  




on the daily its consolidated and the bands are tight enough to turn your wifes boyfriend into a two pump chump you can see it bounced hard off the bottom band in the past few days

look at what happened last friday when the dock workers settled for an insulting  raise and a guarantee that efficiency would not get in the way of union boss salaries

  




so what makes me sooooo smart and special nothing i just happen to be in the right place at the right time like i said ive been watching this stockcompany for years as a matter of personal interest this is the inflection point no one cares about this stock and most people still think the b brand no longer exists at all analysts are asleep at the wheel relying on chatgpt to do their work for them and gpt doesnt know how to spoof an email and listen to a webcast yet

heres the webcast featuring lemonis that took place on sept

14,13,1728620598.0,"Spirit Airlines - A look into the future  As many of you all know by now, Spirit Airlines has had a rough couple of years. They have not been profitable since before COVID and their failed merger with JetBlue has caused their stock to plummet by 95% in the past years. Recently, the WSJ has reported that Spirit Airlines has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy which should not be confused for a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. A Chapter 7 bankruptcy involves the immediate selling of assets to pay back creditors while Chapter 11 is less severe and involves a reorganizational plan to pay back their debt. This distinction is very important because it does not mean that Spirit Airlines is for sure a dead company....yet?...maybe?

Creditors

* Spirit Airlines faces a deadline from its creditors to refinance or extend those notes by 10/21
   * If Spirit is able to refinance their debt, I would safely say that their stock price would increase
   * In addition, if Spirit was able to refinance their debt, this could allow Spirit to tap into the capital market and help them raise more money for a potential turnaround in the future
* Creditors may be inclined to extend their notes because they also have a lot to loose and the Justice Department claiming that Spirit is essential for travelers could build more confidence in the company

Earnings

* Earnings are expected to drop on 10/24 and the estimate is -$2.32...
   * This honestly is not surprising and I can see it going even lower then estimated but I also think it will not affect the price of the stock much
* If Spirit was to beat earnings, it could possibly prove that this company is still alive and has a potential for a turnaround

I felt like updating you guys about Spirit and their potential for a come back but who knows, I am just a Wendy's employee

Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway has sold $10.5bn worth of Bank of America shares in a selling spree that began in July, as the sprawling industrial conglomerate dumps an investment that dates to the global financial crisis. 

The company disclosed on Thursday that it had sold a further 13.6mn shares this week worth $546mn, taking Berkshire’s stake in the bank below 10 per cent.

That threshold is critical and means Berkshire will no longer have to report its dispositions of Bank of America stock within days of the transactions. Berkshire’s remaining stake is worth roughly $31bn.

2,3,1728655664.0,"GOOGLE - The Actual Pioneer and Leader In AI This is a follow up  post to my analysis of TESLA VS WAYMO. 


Right now OpenAI is the clear leader when it comes to developing AI. Everyone else is playing catch up, however there's one company that doesn't get enough credit - GOOGLE. 


Google is the one that actually did most of the groundbreaking work in AI. They're the pioneers of technology in the field of AI. 


You must be thinking Why didn't we hear about this if they're the pioneers of AI? 


The reason is that Google failed to be the first one to commercialise it. 

Google had something called ""PROJECT MOONSHOTS.""  It was basically a division of Google solely focused on Ultra Ambitious Projects. 

AI research and development was a part of it.

In 2014 Google acquired DeepMind Labs that was founded in the UK in 2010.

DeepMind introduced neural Turing machines (neural networks that can access external memory like a conventional Turing machine), which is basically a computer that loosely resembles short-term memory in the human brain.


The Founding Research and Development Team of OpenAI, actually came from Google (DeepMind).


Now going back to ""PROJECT MOONSHOTS"" - in 2010 Larry Page and Sergy Brin turned  ""Project Moonshots"" into ""X COMPANY"".

Yes, it's called X, and they did it before Musk LMAO. 

This is what X Company does -

X's mission is to invent and launch ""moonshot"" technologies that aim to make the world a radically better place.

 A moonshot is defined by X as the intersection of a big problem, a radical solution, and breakthrough technology. 

Work at X is overseen by entrepreneur scientist Astro Teller, as CEO and ""Captain of Moonshots"".

The lab started with the development of Google's self-driving car.


SELF DRIVING VEHICLES are a brainchild of X Company. 

They are also working on some secret projects (presumably alongside the US government).


While Google fell behind OpenAI in commercializing and marketing of AI, they are still a leader in everything related to AI, Machine Learning and Fully Autonomous Vehicles.

TLDR;

GOOGLE IS EVERYTHING ELON MUSK IS CLAIMING TO BE.

1255,427,1728508296.0,"17 years ago today On September 18, 2007, the Fed made a 50bps rate cut, greater than expected, despite reasonably good economic data. Markets rallied for about 3 weeks, and SPX closed at an all-time high on October 9, 2007, which would not be matched again until March 2013 in recovery from the Great Financial Crisis.

On September 18, 2024, the Fed made a 50bps rate cut, greater than expected, despite reasonably good economic data. Markets rallied for about 3 weeks, and SPX closed at an all-time high today, October 9, 2024.

This is not financial advice nearly as much as it is anecdotal evidence that we live in the Matrix.

Other thoughts:

The Sahm rule stood at only 17bps as of the unemployment reading of September 2007, as opposed to 50bps in September 2024. Albeit, unemployment was generally higher right around 4.6-4.7% between late 2006-2007. Additionally, the part-time gig economy is MASSIVE today compared to 2007 (but BLS still counts that as not “unemployed”)

The VIX was hovering between 16-18 during the October 2007 market peak, compared to 20-22 today.

Year-over-year CPI change from December 2006 to December 2007 was 4.1%, so inflation was NOT dead when the Fed started their easing cycle. The bond market is implying a similar problem in today’s economy with increasing US treasury yields, although current YoY CPI readings are generally lower today than in 2007.

Unlike 2007, this is an election year, and I operate under the assumption that all current BLS statistics are not just cooked, but deep fried.

EDIT: Going to try to address some of the repeated comments I’m seeing here.

“PAST PERFORMANCE DOESN’T GUARANTEE FUTURE RESULTS”

Of course, the main point of this post was to highlight the similarities in timelines between today and 17 years ago. Our economic situation is MASSIVELY different, although I’d argue still weak.

“BUT THERE’S NO SUBPRIME CRISIS”

Right, probably not. However, we still have skyrocketing consumer credit defaults paired with an abysmally low personal savings rate. Additionally, we have something along the lines of $1 trillion CRE loans with balloon payments or adjustable rates kicking in within the next 6 months, on a bunch of loans that are underwater with their respective banks, and many of which have been collateralized into CLOs and sold both domestically and internationally. I still think there will be some blood in the water.

Additionally, the median house price to median income ratio is HIGHER today than it was at its 2007-2008 absolute peak, so I’d still argue that real estate has been over-speculated.

“THE GOVERNMENT WON’T LET THE MARKET CRASH DURING AN ELECTION YEAR”

Probably not! In fact, there’s a very real scenario where the Fed steps in with hyper-QE if things hit the fan. Congress is scheduled to meet in January 2025 to negotiate the current US debt ceiling, and the US frankly can’t afford a recession right now - they need those tax dollars. Hyperinflation to erode the real value of the US debt and prop up the markets is highly plausible IMO.

“DUMB BER”

Dumb bol.

“POSITIONS OR BAN”

I’m short term bullish on bonds. TLT just bounced off its 200 SMA twice and I wouldn’t be surprised to see investors eat up those nice high yields if earnings season goes sour. I have 6 figures on TLT calls expiring post-election, I’m gonna wait on SPX plays until the election is over.

**TLDR: The Fed cut rates on the exact same date (9/18) in 2007 as 2024, and SPX hit an all-time high on the exact same date (10/9) in 2007 as 2024, except it was a massive crash afterwards in 2007. Trippy.**"," years ago today on september   the fed made a bps rate cut greater than expected despite reasonably good economic data markets rallied for about  weeks and spx closed at an alltime high on october   which would not be matched again until march  in recovery from the great financial crisis

Those idiots in 1980 would absolutely suck today. They'd be too slow and too dumb to play anywhere near the top league today. Same with other sports. 

That's human nature. Through time we improve incrementally. We use the knowledge of prior generations as a base and add to it. So it's no surprise that an NBA player from 1980 would look like Krusty the Clown on a modern NBA team.

Well guess what, same shit has happened in investing & trading. And on an even bigger scale. The stakes are much higher. Instead of your high school star athlete making the big leagues, we're talking about the most powerful companies in the world making superyacht money. The amount of resources devoted to ""solving"" markets is astronomical.

So now we have a different landscape from your dad's stupid tech company in 1998. Yeah, they were cute firing up their shitty computers and randomly pressing some buttons in a suit & tie. Investors were onto something back in the 90's tech bubble though. They realized the trick to investing...

FRONT RUN EVERYTHING

Yeah bitch. Front run fucking everything. Radio on the internet? Fuck it, here's a billion dollars. Pets.com? Sure, you get $500M. Yeah, they took it a little too far in the 90's. But guess what, they were right. The internet was the future and the right early bets on internet companies made you wildly rich.

The reality was that, you could be wrong on 20 picks so long as you had the 1 Amazon / Microsoft / Apple. Plus, since people weren't front running as much back then, you didn't need to drop 100X Price-Sales on most of these picks (pre-1999). So who the fuck cares if you bought [Pets.com](http://Pets.com), [Broadcast.com](http://Broadcast.com), your dad's shitty tech startup? So long as you just accidentally bought one of the fucking juggernauts, all mistakes were easily forgiven.

So yeah, today we are thinking ""DAMN, Everything is so Expensive!"" ""AI is a Bubble!"" But guess what, that's just Boomer talk. From now on, everything that has a remote chance at being successful is gonna be front run to shit. You can forget about getting in at the bottom floor. Once an industry even hints that it will make a splash, some bastards are going to buy the shit out of it. The days where your dumb ass is gonna find Tesla at $10 or NVDA at $50 are long gone buddy.

GTCR, actual investors and not regards like yourselves, is probably taking Peloton private. It owns 14 million shares as of June 30 (, with a likely cost of $3.22 per share, representing 3.775% of the company’s shares outstanding (CSO). While GTCR has a history of fully buying out closely-held companies, that is unlikely to be the case here. If its purpose is to influence the board, a significant ownership stake is generally around 5% to 10% or more, which can provide leverage in discussions with the company. GTCR would need to acquire at least another 5-6 million shares to surpass the 5% threshold, which would require the firm to file a Schedule 13D, indicating control intent. My speculation is that GTCR will continue to buy shares throughout this quarter and beyond to gain leverage with the board, especially as the company searches for a permanent CEO. The timing seems well-suited for both Peloton’s corporate restructuring and GTCR’s long-term strategy to influence control of the company. We will know more next quarter from its 13F disclosure.

* **Debt:** Zero. Yep, you read that right. Lululemon has a clean balance sheet.
* **Free Cash Flow:** Last year, they generated $1.7 billion in free cash flow, which is pretty solid compared to their $1.6 billion net income.

* **5-Year Revenue Growth:** 23.5%
* **3-Year Revenue Growth:** 25.5%

**Brand Power**

Lulu has a cult-like following. People love this brand. The community and lifestyle they promote are strong. But sentiment can shift quickly, and that’s what we’re seeing now.

The price is down today after spiking to $9 post NSN contract announcement. I look for a culmination of factors - not the least of which is a solid, cohesive, and inspired core team - when making such a bet, and I am supremely confident this stock will hit at least $12 by end of year with the potential, of course, to run much higher. This is how I anticipate it playing out.

The recent 4.8B NSN contract win is mind blowing. The market, in my view, has not yet come to terms with the implications of this contract as we see the price today pulling back to the low 7s. As we make our way to Nov earnings we should expect a gradual increase and a solid earnings beat, which will propel the stock higher leading up to the second moon landing mission (IM2) currently on track for early 2025. Exact date has yet to be announced. IM1 ralled the stock to $13 before it came back to earth. IM2 may not have the same hype, but the company is in a radically different position than it was a year prior.

Celsius ($CELH) the 200mg caffeine nectar from the Gods that blasted onto, and disrupted, the entire energy drink scene.  The growth has been unprecedented in the soft drink scene.  Revenue has grown 24% YOY, and increased $80 million dollars last quarter alone.   Not only is it growing fast, but profit margins also keep improving each quarter.  This is a healthy, thriving, and GROWING business.  Foreign markets are still essentially untapped; once it expands globally, this thing will be a giant.  The stock price this year, however, has not been reflective of the company's success.  Pepsi is one of the main distributors of Celsius, and they bought a little too much inventory so there will be some smaller orders in the short term.  Ok cool, don't care.  There has been some bad press around the energy drink market in general saying consumers are buying less because of inflation.  Still don't care.  $CELH is now cheaper on a P/E basis than Coca-Cola, which is a ZERO GROWTH stagnant company.  While the stock has been getting gutted this year, every cuck on wallstreet has put their grubby little hands in the honey pot and sold it short; and short interest has now grown to \~13%.  But ut-oh, is that Celsius' music? A 10% rip today is going to be a big problem if you're short.  Through this entire downswing, institutional investors have been gobbling up the stock, increasing their positions by more that 400% so far in 2024.  The smart money knows that this is a healthy company with bad press and charmin-soft mfs selling it for way too cheap.  It's currently extremely oversold based on the RSI and the MACD is curling.

I'm using the same analysis that I used for ADSK (+40% return), GTLB (+45% return), COST (+20% return), PGR (+28% return), and CAT (+25% return). You can see deets on those in my post history.

First, here's what my model predicts:

https://preview.redd.it/mw8a6y2ozxtd1.png?width=1858&format=png&auto=webp&s=50eef67e1fb2c60b19ab43fe56b7bad8c96ce6a2

It says a fair value right now for the contracts is about $7.5; I got mine for $7. A Monte Carlo simulation based on the underlying stock's historical behavior in the 30 days leading up to earnings and ATM contract IV run-up suggests the option should, on average, rise in value over the next 30 days. The upper red line is the 90% percentile, the blue line is the mean, and the lower lines are the 10% and 1%, respectively.

Based on fundamentals, I think we'll see the stock rise over the next 30 days, because:

* INGR always beats EPS estimates, so as forecasts start getting dialed in over the next few weeks, buying should pick up.
* The company has an internal initiative called ""Cost2Compete"", started last year, where they're driving down costs. As they predicted, this year sale revenue is down, but because of Cost2Compete their costs are down *lower* and so profit is up YoY.
* They are targeting $50M in cost savings by end of 2025, and are at $18M currently. They didn't revise that $50M number, so I expect to see higher savings this quarter than last, meaning even *higher* profitability.
* They withstood inflation and high rates just fine, and their forex impacts were a wash so far this year, so as inflation drops, sales should pick up. Combined with reduced costs, they should show excellent earnings, and I think the market will foresee that.
* Their guidance for this coming quarter is still conservative, and was made pre-rate cuts and inflation reports, so sales might *already* be up.

I'll be looking to close this one around 25-30%, depending on how IV goes over the next week or two.","preearnings calls on ingr ingredion i bought  ingr  c  this morning to profit from an expected runup in iv and delta prior to earnings being released on

6,9,1728567631.0,"Put LEAPS on VIX ETFs? I view this sub as a great place to double-check my idiotic options plays with people that actually know what they're doing. So my current crusade is essentially just buying LEAP puts on VIX ETFs such as UVXY and UVIX. This isn't the typical ""Short the VIX"" play, as my bearishness on these ETFs comes from something else. The conviction I have for this play comes from the long-term backwardation that occurs with these futures ETFs, where if you literally zoom out to any time frame longer than 2 years on any VIX futures ETF, you will see that most of them are down 70-90% from that time frame, and if you check their whole price history since their inception, it will most probably be down like 99%. I've only checked the price history of put options on UVXY dating back to about 6 months ago, and it seems like the prices are trending up like I expected them, but I would like to get some more price data dating back to as long as possible to see there isn't some regarded options variable I forgot to consider, which is why I have reserved some time at my university's trading lab on a bloomberg terminal later this week to get that price history. I will report back with my findings and if they support my hypothesis, then I will probably go through with this play (also if no one tells me that there is some insanely complicated way that I'm gonna get fucked with this play on this sub).

So, am I the CEO of Dunning-Kruger, or am I onto something?","put leaps on vix etfs i view this sub as a great place to doublecheck my idiotic options plays with people that actually know what theyre doing so my current crusade is essentially just buying leap puts on vix etfs such as uvxy and uvix this isnt the typical short the vix play as my bearishness on these etfs comes from something else the conviction i have for this play comes from the longterm backwardation that occurs with these futures etfs where if you literally zoom out to any time frame longer than  years on any vix futures etf you will see that most of them are down  from that time frame and if you check their whole price history since their inception it will most probably be down like  ive only checked the price history of put options on uvxy dating back to about  months ago and it seems like the prices are trending up like i expected them but i would like to get some more price data dating back to as long as possible to see there isnt some regarded options variable i forgot to consider which is why i have reserved some time at my universitys trading lab on a bloomberg terminal later this week to get that price history i will report back with my findings and if they support my hypothesis then i will probably go through with this play also if no one tells me that there is some insanely complicated way that im gonna get fucked with this play on this sub

0,80,1728631486.0,"Taking out a loan to trade with.  I know I know. But hear me out. 

My business got approached by one of our previous loan providers for another loan. With a previous partnership and excellent repayment history, they are offering a very good rate. Essentially we are almost certainly going to do a 50k loan, but we were approved for up to 150k. 

There lies the problem. I have had great success wheeling dumb stocks, but I thought with the extra 100k I could wheel SPY which is considered as safe as it gets. The premium from weekly selling CSP and CCs would be more than the interest by a pretty significant percentage. 


So, how good or bad of an idea is it to take out an extra 100k for wheeling SPY? ","taking out a loan to trade with  i know i know but hear me out
